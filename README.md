# hello-world
My first repository 
My name is Sarah, and I am a Senior at WVU. Iâ€™m from Grafton, WV. Grafton is only 30 minutes away from Morgantown. I am a Painting Major, and I have a minor in Interactive Design for Media. When I find free time I usually enjoy painting, playing video games, or doing yoga. On the weekends I travel the east coast or visit one of my 8 siblings.
